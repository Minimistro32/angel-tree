# Overview

This NodeJS web app was created to further my understanding of web development using a framework.  This project improved my understanding of JavaScript modules, hosting a local server using NodeJS, and fetching data from online APIs.  

The app is a Pokemon team builder.  The user can filter Pokemon based on their types and add the ones they want to their team of six.  The Pokemon they add is stored in local storage and is pulled when the user loads the team page.  The team page displays a their team with more detail and allows them to select which moves each Pokemon has. 

The purpose for writing this software was to become more proficient in web development.  


Here is a link to a YouTube video of me walking through the software.

# Web Pages

On the index.html page the list of Pokemon is dynamically created using the PokeAPI.  There are options to display 18 different lists of Pokemon.  The team page dynamically displays the Pokemon on the user's team.
